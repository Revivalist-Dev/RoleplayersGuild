/*
  This file is for styles specific to the React components.
  Global styles like 'body', ':root', etc., have been removed
  to prevent conflicts with the main website's stylesheet.

  You can add styles for your editor components here. For example:

  #character-editor-root .my-custom-class {
    border: 1px solid red;
  }
