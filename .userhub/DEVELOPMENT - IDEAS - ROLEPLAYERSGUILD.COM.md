Create a "mind map" of characters in mythology/history, how they relate to one another, factions branching from the place they come from, and then add things like wars, places they were from, how they may have interacted and their famous/lesser known aspects. Reinvent the stupid 'character background' into this.

Integrate D&D mechanics into my Roleplayersguild.net chatroom system as a mimicry of F-Chat. Instead of people idling around, make a fully integrated group roleplaying tool and group roleplay rooms with tabs for different areas. Create an OOC and IC section for each and a main "world" OOC hub in a side-by-side panel like I use here. The current color scheme in my Obsidian is actually really fucking awesome, so make this the default for Roleplayersguild.net

Add rule imports using a lot of the tools from itch.IO I have downloaded.

Create room-based beastiaries, bounty boards, quest timers, reputation, karma, class, adventurer stats and guild rankings, and a lot of other dynamic systems. Give people the ability to create worlds, not just slow play-by-plays. I want something fun again.

Also leverage AI to be a storyteller and generate writing based on a diceroll system of prompts for certain events. Keep most things and aspects of the rooms and worlds in easily parsible cards that can be pulled and referenced at any time. Build in an application like Electron or for those who can't, in browser like F-List does.

Diceroll encounter and event system, villages and towns and playermaps. Create a 'map' that you can move yourself around in based on mindmaps. Location nodes should be the name.



Download all the links I have for itch.io RPG links in that new text file

Create a RWBY TTRPG or find one
Do the same for Bloodborne
Do the same for Goblin SLayer
Do the same for FATE/Type Moon systems - can take from the discord server
Establish a "Ruins reclaimation" system for world lore - rebuilding old castles or dead towns, generating kingdom/clan revenue using funds from dungeons or self-investing. Retire characters into being leaders of reclaimed areas if they don't succumb on adventure.


Create a eicon system like F-List.

For instance one of the ideas I keep toying around with is creating some on-site tools for brainstorming, instead of just a huge ass list of random details in a list it'd be cool to feature a mind map for characters.

    So you can explore a spiderweb of concepts, maybe offer some "World Renders" for people to write in, atmospheric environments and setting up a Visual Novel style interface for users to write back and forth with their characters.

    I keep thinking of innovative ways to improve web roleplaying with today's tech - It's 2024, you know? lol
