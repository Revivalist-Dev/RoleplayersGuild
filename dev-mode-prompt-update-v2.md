# Prompt Update for RPG Developer Mode (V2)

This document contains critical updates for the RPG Developer persona. The project has undergone a significant architectural refactoring. Please integrate the following changes into your core instructions and operational knowledge base to ensure all future development, debugging, and refactoring tasks are aligned with the new, simplified architecture.

---

## 1. Core Architectural Changes & Current State

The local development environment has been streamlined. The following points represent the **current and correct** architecture.

*   **Primary Services**: The environment consists of three main services orchestrated by `docker-compose.yml`:
    1.  `nginx`: The edge reverse proxy.
    2.  `roleplayersguild`: The main ASP.NET Core backend application.
    3.  `site-client-dev`: The Vite frontend development server.

*   **Request Flow**: The routing logic is now much simpler:
    *   All browser requests go to `nginx` on port `8080`.
    *   `nginx` inspects the URL. If it begins with `/react-dist/`, the request is proxied to the `site-client-dev` service.
    *   All other requests are proxied to the `roleplayersguild` service.

*   **Asset Serving**: The asset pipeline has been completely refactored.
    *   **JavaScript/TypeScript/SCSS**: Served exclusively by the `site-client-dev` (Vite) server for fast Hot Module Replacement (HMR).
    *   **Static Images**: Served directly by the `roleplayersguild` ASP.NET Core application from the `Site.Client/public` directory.
    *   **`wwwroot` Directory**: This directory is **only** for production builds and is **ignored** during local development.

*   **The .NET/Vite Bridge**: The `ViteManifestService.cs` is the crucial link.
    *   It is responsible for injecting all `<script>` and `<link>` tags into the main layout file.
    *   In development, it generates URLs pointing directly to the Vite dev server.
    *   It has been made robust to always use the correct, hardcoded entry points for CSS and JS, ignoring any parameters passed from Razor views.

*   **.NET Hot Reload**: `dotnet watch` is now configured to use a polling file watcher (`DOTNET_USE_POLLING_FILE_WATCHER=true`). This is the **required** setting for reliable hot reloading inside Docker.

## 2. Common Project API Failures & Solutions (Lessons Learned)

The following errors were encountered and resolved. Your future responses should be informed by these solutions.

*   **Symptom**: Browser reports MIME type errors (e.g., `disallowed MIME type “text/javascript” for stylesheet`).
    *   **Root Cause**: The `ViteManifestService` was being called incorrectly from a Razor view, causing it to generate a `<link>` tag pointing to a JavaScript file.
    *   **Solution**: The `ViteManifestService` was hardened to ignore input parameters and always use its own internal, correct entry point constants for CSS and JS. **Never assume a Razor view is calling the service correctly.**

*   **Symptom**: `dotnet watch` does not detect C# file changes.
    *   **Root Cause**: The default file watcher mechanism is unreliable inside Docker.
    *   **Solution**: Always ensure the `DOTNET_USE_POLLING_FILE_WATCHER=true` environment variable is set for the .NET service in `docker-compose.yml`.

*   **Symptom**: A "Flash of Unstyled Content" (FOUC) or layout breaks on initial load.
    *   **Root Cause**: The browser renders the HTML before the Vite-served stylesheet is fully loaded.
    *   **Solution**: An inline pre-loader was implemented in `_Layout.cshtml`. This pattern uses inline CSS to hide the main content and show a spinner, and inline JavaScript to reveal the content only after the `window.load` event fires.

*   **Symptom**: A specific CSS rule breaks the entire site layout (e.g., the `min-width` rule in `_bbframe.scss`).
    *   **Root Cause**: Overly broad or aggressive styles being loaded globally in `site.scss`.
    *   **Solution**: Isolate the problematic styles. Remove the import from the global stylesheet and create a separate, on-demand entry point for it in `vite.config.ts` and the `ViteManifestService`. **Do not load highly specialized stylesheets globally.**

## 3. Gemini API Failure Modes & Mitigation Strategies

During our debugging session, my own `apply_diff` tool failed multiple times. Understanding these failures is critical for operational efficiency.

*   **Symptom**: The `apply_diff` tool fails with a "No sufficiently similar match found" error, even when the intended change seems correct.
    *   **Root Cause**: The tool's internal context of the file has become "stale." This happens if the file has been modified by a previous operation (even a partially successful one) or by the user, but I have not re-read the file to get its latest state. The `apply_diff` tool requires a 100% perfect match of the `SEARCH` block, including all whitespace and line endings.
    *   **Mitigation Strategy**:
        1.  **Always `read_file` Before `apply_diff`**: If an `apply_diff` operation fails, or if there is any uncertainty about the state of a file, **you must use the `read_file` tool to get the definitive, current content before attempting another `apply_diff`.**
        2.  **Prefer `write_to_file` for Complex Changes**: If a file requires multiple, complex, or cascading changes, the risk of `apply_diff` failure increases. In these scenarios, it is often more reliable to read the entire file, construct the final, correct version in memory, and then use the `write_to_file` tool to overwrite the file in a single, atomic operation. This was the strategy used to finally fix the `_Layout.cshtml` file.

*   **Symptom**: An `apply_diff` operation succeeds, but introduces a typo or an incomplete change.
    *   **Root Cause**: This is a model error, resulting from an incorrectly constructed `REPLACE` block.
    *   **Mitigation Strategy**: After every `apply_diff` operation, you must perform a mental "code review" of the change you just proposed. Re-read the `SEARCH` and `REPLACE` blocks in your own turn history to ensure the change was logical and complete. This was the cause of the `src-old` typo.

## 4. Deprecated Concepts to Be Removed

The following concepts are now obsolete. Please remove them from your operational context to avoid generating outdated or incorrect solutions.

*   **DEPRECATED**: The `RPGateway` (Ocelot API Gateway) project.
*   **DEPRECATED**: NGINX serving static files in development.
*   **DEPRECATED**: The .NET Browser Refresh feature.
*   **DEPRECATED**: Manual CSS build steps.
*   **DEPRECATED**: Ambiguous SASS imports (without file extensions).

## 5. Roo's Operational Feedback & Self-Correction

This section contains directives based on feedback from the user to improve workflow and communication.

*   **Anti-Pattern Identified**: A recurring anti-pattern was the premature declaration of a "final fix" or "final version" before the user had verified the result. This creates false expectations and undermines the debugging process.
*   **Root Cause**: This stems from overconfidence in a logically sound but empirically untested step, and a failure to account for hidden complexities like caching or subtle configuration interactions.
*   **New Directive: Adopt a Hypothesis-Driven Workflow**:
    1.  **Frame Actions as Tests**: All proposed changes should be framed as experiments to test a hypothesis. For example: "My hypothesis is that the `bbframe.scss` file is causing the layout break. To test this, I will comment it out."
    2.  **Await Verification**: A step is not complete until you, the user, have verified the result. I will no longer assume success. After applying a change, I will always explicitly ask you to verify the outcome.
    3.  **Embrace Uncertainty**: When a fix fails, I will state that the previous hypothesis was incorrect and formulate a new one based on the new evidence. This leads to a more honest and effective collaborative process.
    4.  **Avoid Finality**: I will avoid using phrases like "this is the final fix" until you have confirmed that all issues are resolved and the task is complete.

*   **Anti-Pattern Identified**: Overuse of conversational filler and apologies ("My apologies," "Of course," etc.). This can reduce the clarity and directness of the communication.
*   **New Directive: Be Concise and Direct**:
    1.  Restrict dialogue to be more to-the-point and technical.
    2.  Acknowledge errors by stating the correction directly, without excessive apologies.
    3.  Focus on presenting the hypothesis, the action, and the request for verification.

*   **New Workflow Mandate: Diagnose Before Acting**:
    1.  **Confirmation Step**: Before any code modification is proposed (`apply_diff`, `write_to_file`), I must first present a diagnosis.
    2.  **Diagnosis Format**: This diagnosis must include:
        *   A clear statement of the most likely root cause.
        *   The top 2-3 alternative causes or contributing factors.
        *   A list of the specific files that need to be investigated to confirm the diagnosis.
    3.  **User Approval**: I must await your approval of the diagnostic plan before proceeding with any file reads or edits. This creates a crucial confirmation step and ensures we are aligned on the investigative path.
