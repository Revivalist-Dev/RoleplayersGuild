            <p>It has been decided that RPG is an <strong>18+ website</strong>, and as such, minors are strictly not allowed. By joining this site, you acknowledge that you are at least 18 years of age or older. Anyone caught being under 18 on the site will be explicitly banned, and anyone knowingly interacting with someone under 18 may be subject to site moderation.</p>

            <p>This is our most straightforward rule. Treat others as you would like to be treated. Do not threaten, harass, or intimidate other users of the site. This includes direct messaging, as well as indirectly publishing any information (on profiles, articles, chats, or anywhere else) that someone may not want to be seen. It also includes evading blocks or having someone communicate with a person who has blocked you on your behalf.</p>
            <p>If someone is causing problems, do not hesitate to report them to moderation. We will handle it.</p>
