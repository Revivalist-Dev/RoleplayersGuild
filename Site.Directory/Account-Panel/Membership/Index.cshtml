<h1>Role-Players Guild Paid Membership</h1>

<p>Thank you for your interest in becoming a paid member of RPG. We couldn't have made it this far without the support of all of you.</p>
<p>Your continued support is deeply appreciated and since we've put an official code freeze on RPG, it's time to move on to RPG2. The new system will be written on a much more scalable infrastructure and be able to support our growth and expansion without a problem. We'll also be able to offer much more refined features to our users!</p>
<p>To celebrate the end of RPG1, we've made a change to the logic of our membership system. Now, if you buy a $5/mo membership, you can cancel it at any time after the initial payment and continue to reap the benefits of a paid membership without having to renew every month. No ads, unlimited images, and even a chance to get a secret badge if the whole community raises $5,000.</p>
<p>Once you have your membership activated, you can cancel it by going to PayPal and simply telling PayPal to cancel any further payments. Again; this will not get in the way of anything you already have. If you'd like to help RPG reach the $5,000 goal, however, you can also keep the membership active! Members with paid memberships active from September 2017 until the launch of RPG2 will receive another RPG2 exclusive badge!</p>
<p>So, to recap, here is what you get if you buy a Premium Membership:</p>
<ul>
    <li>No Ads</li>
    <li>Unlimited Image Slots for Account</li>
    <li>Platinum Member Badge (Blue Name w/ Blue Glow)</li>
    <li>Unlimited Images Badge (White Name w/ Blue Glow)</li>
    <li>Secret Badge If $5,000 Funding Goal Is Reached</li>
    <li>Secret RPG2 Badge If Membership Active From September 2017 To Launch of RPG</li>
</ul>
<p>Users with the old Bronze/Silver/Gold memberships will be able to participate in this by canceling their current memberships and purchasing this one.</p>
