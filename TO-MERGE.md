Recommended Packages & Tools for a Roleplaying Website

To build a rich, interactive, and modern roleplaying site, consider integrating the following tools and libraries.

Purpose & Benefit

Real-Time Chat
	

Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR
	

For features like your in-character chat rooms, SignalR is the definitive solution. It enables real-time, bi-directional communication between the server and clients. You can use it to push new chat messages to all connected users instantly without them needing to refresh the page. This is a massive upgrade over older polling-based chat systems.

Text Editor
	

TinyMCE / CKEditor
	

For any "long form" text entry (character bios, story posts, forum messages), you need a good client-side WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) editor. Both TinyMCE and CKEditor are powerful, highly customizable, and provide a familiar word processor-like experience for your users, including text formatting, image embedding, and more.

Markdown Processing
	

Markdig
	

Instead of storing raw HTML from a rich text editor, a more modern and secure approach is to have users write in Markdown. Markdig is a very fast and powerful .NET library that can parse Markdown input from a user and safely convert it to HTML on the server for display. This gives you full control over the final HTML and prevents malicious scripts.

Full-Text Search
	

Elasticsearch / Azure AI Search
	

For a site with a large amount of user-generated text (character profiles, stories, forum posts), the basic SQL LIKE operator is slow and inefficient for searching. A dedicated search engine like Elasticsearch provides incredibly fast, relevant, and powerful search capabilities (e.g., typo tolerance, ranking by relevance, filtering by genre).

Job Scheduling
	

Hangfire / Quartz.NET
	

For running background tasks on a schedule. For example, you could use this to run a nightly job that awards "One Year Member" badges, cleans up old records, or sends out weekly summary emails.

Client-Side Framework
	

Vue.js / React
	

For building highly interactive user interfaces (like a dynamic character sheet or a real-time chat client), a lightweight JavaScript framework can be invaluable. It allows you to create responsive and complex UIs without full page reloads, providing a much smoother user experience.
